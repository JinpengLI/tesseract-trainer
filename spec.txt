The program has 3 modes:

1. Generate - it saves a tiff/box pair in a directory chosen by the user.

2. Preview - it creates a tiff file in the temporary directory, and
applies the bounding boxes as red rectangles, and shows them to the user.
The program opens the image in the user's default viewer for TIFF files.

3. Generate and install - it saves the tiff/box pair in a temporary directory,
the name is specified by the user in an edit box, after which it saves the
install script, specified by the user, and launches it

------------------

The input of the program comes from a plain text edit control. The text from
that control is then rendered onto an image, and the resulting image and *.box
file are saved in a directory chosen by the user.

These font settings can be specified by the user - font name, font size in points,
bold, italic, monospace and anti-aliasing. The output image resolution (in
pixels) and DPI can be specified by the user. Setting DPI to zero will cause
the default DPI to be used. When the values for any of these controls changes,
the 2 plain text edit boxes fonts are automatically updated.

The program currently supports only single page TIFF files.

The program supports specifying multiple characters in a single bounding box -
akin to ligatures. This means that instead of giving 2 bounding boxes for the
2 characters, it gives a single bounding box, but specifies the 2 characters as a
character. These composite characters are entered in the plain text edit box
to the right, separated by spaces.

TODO:
------------------

Support multipage TIFF.

Support viewing tif/box pairs where the boxes are applied as red rectangles.
